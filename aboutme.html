			<p>My name is Jose Antonio Raygoza and I am 16 years old. I currently attend Damien High school as a Junior. I have 1 brother who is currently a freshman at Damien Highschool. Both of my parents were born in Mexico and my mom grew up there as well. My dad moved to the US very young, and grew up here. All of my mom's side of the family is in Mexico, so we go visit them once or twice a year. I also have a dog. He is a male chihuahua and his name is Giovanni.</p>
